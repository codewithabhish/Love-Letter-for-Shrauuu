        <h1>My Dearest Shrauu,</h1>
        <p>
            I just wanted to take a quiet moment to tell you how much you truly mean to me. Sometimes, words feel too small to hold all the feelings I have for you—but I’ll still try ✍❤
         <p> You’ve brought a kind of peace and happiness into my life that I didn’t even know I was missing. With you, everything feels better—days are brighter ☀, smiles come easier 😊, and even the quiet moments feel like magic ✨. Just being around you makes everything more meaningful.</p>
           <p>I admire so many things about you—your strength, your heart, your laugh, and the way you carry yourself with grace and authenticity 💫. You’re beautiful in every sense of the word, and I feel so lucky to call you mine 💖</p> 


        </p>
        <p>
            There’s a moment that will always live in my heart—the first time we made love. It wasn’t just physical—it was emotional, deep, and filled with a kind of closeness I’ve never felt before. That night, I didn’t just feel your body next to mine—I felt your soul, and I knew in that moment just how deeply I love you.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being there for me, for understanding me, for making me laugh, and for loving me the way you do. You're not just my girlfriend—you’re my best friend, my peace, my favorite person 💑
            </p>
            <p>I don’t know what life has planned for us, but I do know this—I want you in my every tomorrow ♾</p>
        <p>
            Forever yours,
        </p>
